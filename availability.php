            <p><strong>"</strong>We feel very comfortable leaving Emmi with Kandice. Emmi gave her own stamp of approval by her eagerness to enter and make herself right at home. We love getting the regular pictures and reports on Emmi's activities. Kandice was very helpful and understanding when due to our plane being rerouted we were not able to pick up Emmi until a day later than anticipated. As in her previous visit, Emmi looked great when we picked her up. We will definitely ask Kandice to take care of Emmi in the future.<strong>"</strong></p>
