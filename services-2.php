            <p><strong>Here's where we'll take our walks</strong></p>
            <p>Madrona - our quiet, residential neighborhood. We are convenient to downtown and close to Lake Washington. Madrona has quiet streets, trails, and green spaces. I also love to walk in the Arboretum, Seward Park, &amp; Discovery Park. I have a minivan for transporting the dogs to a destination hike. If your dog does not enjoy car rides, I will skip these walks.</p>

            <p><strong>Your dog's sleeping arrangement</strong></p>
            <p>In my bedroom, on a dog bed next to my bed or next to one of my kids - on a dog bed or in their bed! Unless your dog is not allowed on beds, then we will not allow it either. Same with the furniture.</p>
            <p>Your dog will have constant companionship, the chance to enjoy the backyard as desired, at least 2 walks a day, and lots of love and attention.</p>

		<h2>Home Visits</h2>

		<div class="panel">
			<p>Price: $23</p>
            <p>Each home visit lasts for approximately 30 minutes and costs $23, each visit can be individualized for your and your pet's specific needs. During the home visit I will take your dog out to relieve, take him on a short walk, if desired.  Clean his food and water dishes and give him fresh water, his food as needed, and any medication that is required.  Any time remaining will be spent playing with your dog.  Games may include "hide and seek," or "fetch," or teaching your dog a new trick.  If your dog prefers we can just relax together and I can talk to him and give him a belly rub or scratch behind his ears.  Of course I will also bring in the mail and any packages or flyers, turn on or off lights, and set your alarm.
